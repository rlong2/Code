These programs are a combination of exercieses and tweaked examples programs
from Sams Teach Yourself C++ by Siddartha Rao, 8th Edition.

I have been using Code::Blocks as an IDE to create these programs,
so each folder contains files relating to Code:Blocks.

If you want to run the C++ code without using Code::Blocks,
simply copy the main.cpp file and compile/run it with g++.
For example: 
g++ main.cpp -o myProgram && ./myProgram
