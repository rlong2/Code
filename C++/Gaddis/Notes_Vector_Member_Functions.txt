at(position)          returns the value of the element located at 'position' in the vector
x = vect.at(5)        // Assigns the value of vect[5] to x

capacity()            returns the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the vector
                      without additional memory being allocated.
x = vect.capacity();  // Assigns the capacity of vect to x

clear()               clears a vector of all its elements
vect.clear();         // removes all elements from the vector

empty()               returns true if the vector is empty. Else, returns false
if (vect.empty());
    cout << "Vector is empty";
    
pop_back()           removes the last element in the vector
vect.pop_back();     // removes the last element of vect

push_back(value)     adds 'value' to the back of the vector
vect.push_back(5)    // adds 5 to end of vector

reverse()            reverses the order of elements in the vector
                     (last element becomes first, first becomes last)
vect.reverse();

resize(n)           resizes a vector to have n elements,
                    where n is greater than the vector's current size.
resize(n, value)    If 'value' is included, each of the new elements is initialized w/ that value
// Example where vect has 4 elements:
vect.resize(6,99)    // Adds two elements to the end of the vector, both set to 99

size()              returns the number of elements in the vector
numElements = vect.size();

swap(vector2)       swaps the contents of vector1 with the contents of vector2
vect1.swap(vect2)    // Swaps contents of vect1 and vect2
