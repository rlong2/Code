When to pass arguments by reference and when to pass arguments by value
From Gaddis, Ch6, p 372.

1. When an argument is constant, it must be passed by value.  
Only variables can be passed by reference.

2. When a variable passed as an argument should not have its value changed,
it should be passed by value. This protects the argument from being altered.

3. When exactly 1 value needs to be returned from a function,
use a 'return' statement rather than a reference parameter.

4. When 2+ variables passed as arguments to a function need to have their
values changed by that function, those values should be passed by reference.

Common instances when reference parameters are used:
- When data values being input in a fucntion need to be known by the calling function.
- When a function must change existing values in the calling function.
- When a file stream object is passed to a function.
