'''
You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. 
The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

Write a program that converts their scores to grades. 
By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades 
that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. 
The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
