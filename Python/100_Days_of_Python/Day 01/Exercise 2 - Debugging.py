''' Fix the code below 👇
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

Output should be:
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
