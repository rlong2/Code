'''
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.

    BMI = weight / height^2
'''
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = float(weight) / float(height)**2
bmi = round(bmi)

if bmi <= 18.5:
    weight_result = "you are underweight."
elif bmi <= 25:
    weight_result = "you have a normal weight."
elif bmi <= 30:
    weight_result = "you are slightly overweight."
elif bmi <= 35:
    weight_result = "you are obese."
else:
    weight_result = "you are clinically obese."

print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, {weight_result}")
