Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

MAX_AGE = 90
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
years = MAX_AGE - int(age)
months = years * 12
weeks = years * 52
days = years * 365

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
